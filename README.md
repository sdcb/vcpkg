# Vcpkg

## Overview
Vcpkg helps you get C and C++ libraries on Windows. This tool and ecosystem are currently in a preview state; your involvement is vital to its success.

For short description of available commands, run `vcpkg help`.

## Quick Start
Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio 2015 Update 3
- `git.exe` available in your path

Clone this repository, then run
```
C:\src\vcpkg> powershell -exec bypass scripts\bootstrap.ps1
```
Then, to hook up user-wide integration, run (note: requires admin on first use)
```
C:\src\vcpkg> .\vcpkg integrate install
```
Install any packages with
```
C:\src\vcpkg> .\vcpkg install sdl2 curl
```
Finally, create a New Project (or open an existing one) in Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio "15" Preview. You can now `#include` and use any of the installed libraries.

## Examples
See the [`docs\EXAMPLES.md`](docs/EXAMPLES.md) document for specific walkthroughs, including using a package and adding a new package.
